Planning with Excel 
-------------------

A `planning` is the essential tool for project management or team management.

Depending on the size of a project or its criticality or reporting requirement, you may need either a simple Excel sheet or a robust and complete market tool. 

For smaller projects, I use a tool developed with Excel and some macros to make my life easier.

This tool, simply called "XLS_Planning", allows you to manage your projects through Excel and monitor progress through reporting.

functionalities 
---------------

In a simple way, you add your projects, the steps (design, development, recipe), then you describe the tasks, the person who performs the task, the start date, the end date, the percentage of progress, comments. An indicator also indicates whether the task in question is late or likely to be late.

A Gantt representation accompanies each project. 
More over, It is possible to integrate all your projects in the same tab or to split them by tab.

Reporting
---------
For follow-up, 2 "Reporting" are available: 
* The first is a list of current and overdue tasks per person.
* The second is a workload plan that displays each person's workload per week



Enjoy :)
